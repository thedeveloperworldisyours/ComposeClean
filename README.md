This Android app helps you memorize your vocabulary. Your mind will create a connection between the word and the image. You can get it if you review your vocabulary by doing a daily test. The daily test has three options.

Features:
- You can group your words.
- Each saved word will have an image and web link.
- You can review your vocabulary with a test.
- In the test, you can choose three options:
  - To choose your list of words within a group.
  - To type the word within a group.
  - To spell out the word like the Hangman game.

This Android app has four screens:
- Group list where you can add and remove groups.
- Wordlist where you can add, edit and delete the words, also view the detailed word with the web view component.
- Test screen where you can choose three options, choose a word from the word list or type the word or spell out the word.
- Statistics screen where you can see your tests results.

How to do the Vocabulary test?
Given a picture, you can choose the correct word if you choose the list option or type the word if you choose the typing option, or spell if you choose the hangman option.
