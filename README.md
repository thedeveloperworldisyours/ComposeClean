This Android app helps you memorize your vocabulary. Your mind will create a connection between the word and the image. You can get it if you review your vocabulary by doing a daily test. Daily test has tree options with different levels.

Features:
+ You can group your words. 
+ Each saved word will have image and web link.
+ You can review your vocabulary with a test screen.
+ In the test, you can choose two options:
     - To choose your list of words within a group.
     - To type the word

This Android app has three screens:
+ group list where you can add and remove groups.
+ word list where you can add, edit and delete the words, also view the detailed word with the web view component.
+ test screen where you can choose two options, choose a word from the word list, or type the word.

How to do the Vocabulary test?
+ Given a picture, you can choose the correct word if you choose the list option or type the word if you choose the typing option or hangman option.
